# Interrupt
An event management app initially developed for Interrupt 7.0 with capabilities of managing events & registrations.
This app can be used by:
- Administrator:- Admin privileges to the app
- Organisers:- Admin for all events.
- Coordinator:- Admin for a particular event
- Participants:- can use the app for schedules, event browsing, registered events etc.

### What is Interrupt?
Interrupt 7.0 is a Techno-Cultural fest Organised & Hosted by the students of Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Dr. Ambedkar Institute of Technology Bengaluru, Karnataka.
It is a 2 Days Extravaganza of Cultural and Technical events.

### Why open source it?
Decided to make this project open source as this can be extended to be used by all for their own collage or school events by making a few changes.

### NOTE
This repo is just made public and needs additional documentation in order to be used by my fellow open source developers.
